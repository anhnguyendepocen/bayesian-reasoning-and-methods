General technology

- how to show/hide R code and output and text all in one?

General material

- more examples, exercises
- See McElreath (2nd), there is some good stuff. e.g. Figure 3.6 for posterior prediction
- Include more spinner illustrations, especially conditional (e.g., posterior prediction)
- Add things that I say in the videos as text, especially intuitive explanations
- Add more links to applets and animation
- Add more illustrations of ideas; not just graphs of posterior/etc, pictures to illustrate ideas (e.g. Markov chain simulation)
- Add quiz questions and HW problems and investigations to notes



Chapter 2

- include mosaic plots?


Chapter 3

- add more base rate fallacy examples
- include plot with comparison of Binomial distributions and ratio of likelihoods
- review Binomial?
- include how could you use simulation to approximate likelihood in Binomial?
- refer to marginal probability of evidence as "average likelihood"
